Level 4 Map Documentation


High-Level Idea: 
* To explore the possibility of the third dimension, in level 4 we added two more elevations: upper and lower.  
* Three elevations have different features. 
* The upper elevation is a set of cooler elements that increase the size of our ball. It contains falling icy grounds, cold areas, and blue cubes 
* The lower elevation is a set of warmer elements that decrease the size of our ball. It contains hot areas and hot cubes. In addition, it has the element wind that can blow our ball up. 
* The middle elevation contains all of our puzzles. Players need to use the properties of upper and lower grounds to solve the puzzle of middle ground.  It contains gates and bridges and the final flag.
